# BDFadingScrollView
It's Swift-ified fork of [SSFadingScrollView](https://github.com/stephsharp/SSFadingScrollView)


A UIScrollView subclass that fades the leading and/or trailing edges of a scroll view to transparent. It animates the gradient in and out based on the current content offset, and uses a mask to fade the scroll view content without also fading the scroll bars.
